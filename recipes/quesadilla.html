        <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>

    <h2>Steps: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li><em>Step 1</em><br>
            Heat butter in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir onion until slightly tender, about 5 minutes.
            Add
            ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, salt, black pepper, and garlic powder; cook and stir until beef is
            browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat, drain liquid from beef, and let sit for 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li><em>Step 2</em> <br>
            Heat a griddle or flat pan over medium heat and spray with cooking spray.</li>
        <li><em>Step 3 </em><br>
            Place 1 tortilla on the hot griddle, top with some of the Colby cheese, 1/4 of the beef mixture, 1 teaspoon
            ketchup, 1 teaspoon mustard, and 1 teaspoon relish. Top with more Colby cheese and 1 tortilla. Flatten the
            quesadilla with your hand.</li>
        <li><em>Step 4</em><br>
            Flip quesadilla with a spatula and cook until browned and cheese is melted, 3 to 5 minutes more. Cut
            quesadilla into 4 pieces. Repeat with remaining tortillas, ground beef, cheese, ketchup, mustard, and
            relish.</li>
    </ol>
